## Code samples for SAP on AWS workshops

The CloudFormation and other code contained inside are used in SAP on AWS workshops, including:
* [SAP HANA on AWS Advanced Workshop (SUSE High Availability)](https://basis-advanced.workshop.aws)
* [SAP on AWS Immersion Day workshop](https://basis-express-immersionday.workshop.aws) (planned)

**Note**: The sample code shared here is built for use in an educational, workshop style format. While it may be used as the basis for code in productive AWS workloads, we strongly recommend further review of the results from a Well-Architected Framework context to ensure the deployed resources meet the security, cost optimization, and auditability requirements of your organization.
